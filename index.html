Coming...soon would probably be an exaggeration...but at one point...
    <p>
    In the meantime vfio notes:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>because guest gpu is boot_gpu I had to throw everything at it</li>
        <li>video=vesafb:off,efifb:off in kernel options</li>
        <li>copy rom from /sys/devices/pci..... and add it to the vm xml</li>
        <li>of course because nvidia, error 43, so entries to the host in the xml also</li>
        <li> and this after boot, so it let's the vm have at it
          
          virsh nodedev-detach pci_0000_2f_00_0
virsh nodedev-detach pci_0000_2f_00_1
virsh nodedev-detach pci_0000_2f_00_2
virsh nodedev-detach pci_0000_2f_00_3
echo efi-framebuffer.0 > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/efi-framebuffer/unbind</li>
        <li>possible that not all of these are needed, but when i tried to revert just one, it would stop working, so i'm leaving it as is</li>
    </ul>
